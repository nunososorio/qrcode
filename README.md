# Clean QR Code Generator 
This repository provides a simple and efficient code for generating QR codes. The tool was developed in response to my need for a “clean” QR code generator that avoids the clutter, ads and complexity found in the web alternatives.

It utilizes the Python qrcode module and offers two modes of operation:
As a Streamlit app, hosted at [[cleanqrcode.streamlit.app]](https://cleanqrcode.streamlit.app/).
As a Jupyter notebook ([qrcode_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nunososorio/qrcode/blob/main/QRCODE.ipynb)), runnable in Google Colab.

If you also need a no-nonsense QR code generator that gets the job done fast, look no further. Enjoy!
