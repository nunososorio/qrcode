# Clean QR Code Generator 
This repository provides a simple and efficient code for generating QR codes. The tool was developed in response to my need for a “clean” QR code generator that avoids the clutter, adds and complexity found in the web alternatives.

It utilizes the Python qrcode module and offers two modes of operation:
As a Streamlit app, hosted at [cleanqrcode.streamlit.app].
As a Jupyter notebook (qrcode_colab.ipynb), runnable in Google Colab.

If you also need a no-nonsense QR code generator that gets the job done look no further. Enjoy!
